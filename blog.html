        <h1> IT Girls Blog: Women in Cryptographing </h1>
       
        <p> Shaila Colon De Leon / July 23rd, 2024</p>
       
        <p1>Throughout history, Science has always been viewed as a male dominated subject, hardly acknowledging the millions of women who helped develop the fundamentals of science and further human innovation, specifically in the field of coding. </p>
        <p2>Science has always been used to find problems to worldly problems, World War II marks as one of the most prominent moments in history where debatably the winning side became victorious through new breakthroughs in science and its intensive use of newly developing technology. Particularly, Code breakers became a vital job that led to the winning side becoming victorious through secret spies decoding enemy messages that helped discover enemy secrets. </p>
        <p3>Pioneering cryptographer Mary Louise Prather climbed her way up the male dominated ranks to a starking position in the Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) as a stenographer. Prather originally entered the SIS in an entry level position as a civilian stenographer but through her dedication to decoding Prather enlarged her knowledge of decoding office machines which became vital skills during the war time that helped decode enemy messages. Her skills conceived of filing encrypted messages, which was an illegal tactic during the war. Secretly, Prather logged the filed messages in code to further hide her knowledge of enemy secrets. Her final contributions consisted of sending the encrypted codes of enemy messages to the appropriate people. </p>
