        Hello! I am a High School Senior and live in Liverpool, New York.
        I aspire to graduate and pursue a field in Mechanical Engineering with a Focus in BioMed Engineering.
        I am originally from the Dominican Republic and I identify with that as my home town, I moved to the US when I was 8. 
        In my free time I like to draw, paint, and ride my bike. My favorite color is Blue and I love my cat, Sebastian.
